# rom-tools

A suite of utilities for working with video game ROMs for classic platforms.

The project is a work in progress and portions are AI-generated. See the maturity legend to understand the quality of the components listed in this README:

- 🤖 Vibe coded with minimal human review, but it probably works on my machine.
- 🧹 AI generated, but cleaned up by a human. Likely contains defects of AI origin.
- 🏗️ Reviewed for architecture or human-engineered from the start. Defects here are of human origin only.
- ✅ Human-engineered and tested on a real game library. Remaining defects are probably edge cases.

## CLI

    go install github.com/sargunv/rom-tools/cmd/rom-tools

- 🤖 `rom-tools identify`: Hash roms and parse their metadata.
